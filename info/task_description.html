    Many countries use different conventions for the thousands separator and decimal mark.  For example in the Netherlands
    one million one thousand two hundred and eighty one-hundredths is written as 1.001.200,80, but in the US this is written
    as 1,001,200.80.  Use your coding skills to convert dollars in the first style (Netherlands, Germany, Russia, Turkey,
    Brazil, and others) to the second style (US, UK, Canada, China, Japan, Mexico, and others).
</p>

<p>
    Only currency amounts in dollars should be converted: $1.234,50 to $1,234.50, $1.000 to $1,000, and $4,57 to $4.57.
    But don't convert your router's IP address 192.168.1.1.  Also leave currency in the US style unchanged.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Input: </strong> A string containing dollar amounts to be converted (unicode for py2).
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Output: </strong> A string with converted currencies.

        <strong>Example:</strong>
    </p>
    <pre class="brush: python">
fix_currency("Lot 192.001 costs $1.000,94.") == "Lot 192.001 costs $1,000.94."
fix_currency("$1,23 + $2,34 = $3,57.") == "$1.23 + $2.34 = $3.57."</pre>

    <strong>How it is used: </strong>
    This is an exercise in working with strings and using the Python standard library.
